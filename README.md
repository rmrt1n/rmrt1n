### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer from Indonesia, currently building
**[Karcis](https://karcis.biz)**, an event ticketing software.

I enjoy systems programming, web development, and tinkering with new 
technologies. These days I mostly use SvelteKit, Next.js, and Clojure for my 
projects. During my free time, I usually try to contribute to open source 
projects.

#### Some of the projects I've worked on:
- **[Karcis](https://karcis.biz)**: An event ticketing software for small to 
  mid-sized event organizers.
- **[Clam.css](https://github.com/rmrt1n/clam.css)**: A good looking, (almost) 
  classless CSS library
- **[Beru](https://github.com/rmrt1n/beru)** &
  **[Grape](https://github.com/rmrt1n/grape)**: Eliability accounting systems for 
  the construction and palm oil industries
- **[Seacucumber](https://github.com/rmrt1n/seacucumber)**: A toy interpreter for a 
  language inspired by OCaml & Scheme
- **[Redis-kw](https://github.com/rmrt1n/redis-kw)**: A compatible Redis clone 
  (both server & client)
- **[RecurriPay](https://github.com/rmrt1n/lepak-scaling-eth-3)**: A Crypto wallet
  that enables recurring payments and social recovery
- **[Contact.app](https://github.com/rmrt1n/contact.app-clj)**: A Clojure 
  implementation of contact.app from the Hypermedia Systems book
- And many other 
  **[hackathon](https://github.com/APU-Blockchain-Cryptocurrency-Club/4ever.data)**
  **[projects](https://github.com/rmrt1n/cybernaut-2)**,
  **[compilers](https://github.com/rmrt1n/muc)**, 
  **[parsers](https://github.com/rmrt1n/parsers)**, 
  **[VMs](https://github.com/rmrt1n/govm)**, 
  **[garbage collectors](https://github.com/rmrt1n/cgc)**,
  **[data analyses](https://github.com/rmrt1n/chess_analysis_project)**, and
  **[CTF](https://github.com/Red-Knights-CTF/writeups)** 
  **[writeups](https://github.com/rmrt1n/overthewire-solutions)**

#### What I use:
I edit `^.+\.(clj|css|c|go|rs|py|html|jsx|js|tsx|ts|svelte|sh)$` files in vim and 
store data in `supabase|postgres|sqlite|xtdb` in a container on a Lenovo laptop 
running **[Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/)**.
